\title{Luminance constancy under fixed geometry}
\abstract{The light that reflects off an object surface and is captured by our eyes varies significantly with its context. But, the human visual system has the ability to stably perceive the object's color invariant of the context variations. The mechanism of this behaviorally significant invariance detection ability remains largely unknown. To understand the computational principles that lead to such invariant perception, we study the perception of LRV under spectral variations in 3D scenes. Specifically, we study the effects of variations in reflectance and illumination spectra in a scene on the perceived luminance of an object. We have developed a software that generates naturalistic multispectral images of 3D scenes with precise control over the geometrical and spectral properties of the constituents that make a scene. We label these images with the luminance of a specific object in the scene. Next, we simulate the response of the retinal cones to these multispectral images using an accurate model of the early visual system. We then use supervised learning methods on these labeled cone responses to identify the computations that lead to accurate luminance estimation. We show that if only either target, or background, or illumination spectra are allowed to vary, the standard luminance can be estimated through simple transformations of the cone responses. When all the spectra vary simultaneously, while it is not easy to recover the luminance through simple transformations, a decoding scheme that compares the light from the target and the surround, and properly adds the response of the L,M and S cones can recover the luminance within about 15\% RMSE.}

\section{Introduction}
The perceived color of an object has important behavioral implications, since color helps to identify objects and their properties \cite{Mollon89, Jacobs81}.
[THIS PERCEIVED COLOR DEPENDS ON THE SURFACE REFLECTANCE OF THE OBJECT.]
Perceived object color is not sensed directly. Rather, it is computed by the brain starting with the retinal image of the light reflected from an object to the eye.
The computational challenge underlying object color perception is that this reflected light depends not just on the object's surface reflectance, but also on extrinsic factors such as the illumination, the object's pose, and the position of the observer (Fig.~\ref{fig:introSchematic}).
To produce a stable perceptual representation correlated with an object's surface reflectance the brain must account for these intrinsic factors on the reflected light.
The ability of a visual system to extract such a stable representation is called color constancy. 
[DO WE NEED THIS LINE -] Although human color constancy is by no means perfect, it is often very good \cite{FosterColorConstancy, BrainardColorConstancy}. 
In this paper, we consider the computational problem of color constancy, that is, how in principle could a visual system process the light reflected to the eye to produce percepts well-correlated with object surface reflectance.

Early work on computational color constancy considered a simplified case with multiple flat matte objects and a single spatially diffuse illuminant \cite{LandRetinex,Buchsbaum80,MaloneyWandell86}. Subsequent computational work considered more complex geometries and incorporated probabilistic descriptions of the statistics of naturally occurring scenes \cite{funt1988color, D'ZmuraConstancy3, barron2012color, D'ZmuraIversonSinger,BrainardFreeman}; LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME RECENT REVIEWS).
A key insight from this computational work is that stable color descriptors of a target object cannot be obtained from the light reflected from the target object alone.  But, it is possible to obtain such descriptors by analyzing jointly the light reflected from all of the objects in the scene.
As a consequence, the performance of color constancy algorithms will be affected by variation in the surface reflectance of all of the objects in the scene \cite{BrainardWandellRetinex}, not just by variation in the illuminant. Thus evaluation of constancy algorithms must include assessment of their performance with respect to both variation in the illumination and the surface reflectance of all of the scene objects \cite{BrainardWandellRetinex,BrainardFreeman}.

    \caption{(a) {\bf Color Constancy:} The light reflected from an object to the eye depends both on the object's surface reflectance of the object and the illumination. It also depends on geometric factors, such as the object's shape, pose, and position relative to the observer. The human visual system is able to account for variations in the reflected light due to object-extrinsic factors and produce a percept of object color that is relatively stable, an ability called color constancy. (b) {\bf Luminance Constancy:} Images of a sphere under a fixed illuminant.  Down each column, the reflectance function of the sphere varies only by a scale factor; the relative reflectance spectrum held fixed.  The relative spectrum (shape of reflectance spectrum) varies across each row.
Within each row, the light reflectance value (LRV) of the spheres is constant. The values on the left of each row provide the corresponding LRV. We cast the problem of computational luminance constancy to be that of estimating LRV from the image, across variation in other scene factors: variation in relative surface reflectance, variation in illumination, and variation in the reflectance of the other objects in the scene.}
 \end{figure}

An alternative approach to computational color constancy, which has been less-well explored, is to use supervised machine learning techniques to develop mappings between input images and stable color descriptors \cite{barron2015convolutional}. The use of supervised learning to understand perceptual capabilities for natural stimuli has enjoyed success in domains outside of color vision. For example, a recently developed technique called accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) learns linear filters optimized for particular perceptual tasks \cite{geisler2009optimal}. It has been used to develop ideal observers for speed, focus error, and disparity estimation that provide excellent models of human performance \cite{burge2011optimal, burge2014optimal, burge2015optimal}. In this paper, we apply AMA to a special case of computational color constancy. 

Supervised learning requires large labeled data sets.  Such data sets are not readily available for the study of color constancy. Although there are databases of calibrated color images, these do not provide ground truth information about surface reflectance and illuminantion at each image location \cite{ChakrabartiHyperspectral,NascimentoFoster2016,ParragaHyperspectralData,TkacikUpennHypersepctralData,skauli2013collection,olmos2004biologically}. There are some smaller databases consisting of images of posed scenes where object surface reflectances are measured individually (\citeNP{funt1988color,ciurea2003large}; \citeauthor{davidPennHyperspectral}), but these are not large enough to drive supervised learning.

The numbers on the left indicate the standard luminance level of the target object. 5 images are shown at each luminance level. We studied four types of spectral variations. Condition 1: target object relative surface reflectance spectrum variable, light source spectra fixed, background object spectra fixed, (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}). (a) Condition 2: target object relative surface reflectance spectrum variable, light source spectra fixed, background object spectra variable, (b) Condition 3: target object relative surface reflectance spectrum variable, light source spectra variable, background object spectra fixed, (c) Condition 4: target object relative surface reflectance spectrum variable, light source spectra variable, background object spectra variable. As in Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}, the spheres in each row of each panel have the same surface luminance, while the spheres in each column of each panel have the same relative surface reflectance.  Moreover, across the four panels (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure} \& Fig.~\ref{fig:studiedCases}), spheres in corresponding locations have the same surface reflectance. In all four panels, the overall lights source spectra scale factors (see \nameref{Methods}) were drawn from a uniform distribution on the range [0.5, 1.5]. The sRGB values for all three panels were normalized using a common scale factor prior to gamma correction.}

\end{figure}

In this paper, we use high-quality computer graphics to generate large data sets of naturalistic images where the surface reflectance and illumination corresponding to each image pixel are known. 
This approach allows us to investigate computational color constancy with naturalistic stimuli, while retaining the ability to control the properties of objects and illuminants. Here, we use this approach to tackle luminance constancy, a constitutive component of the more general color constancy problem (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}). 

We define the computational problem of luminance constancy as that of estimating the light reflectance value (LRV) of an object's surface reflectance function.
The LRV is a measure of the overall amount of light reflected by a surface (\citeauthor{astm1121477}).
More precisely, the LRV is the luminance of the light that would
be reflected to the eye from an object with the specified surface reflectance function when the object is illuminated by a reference illuminant,
normalized by the luminance of the reference illuminant itself.
Here we use CIE daylight D65 as the reference illuminant and the CIE 1931 photopic luminosity function \cite{CIE86}.
LRVs are typically expressed in percent, so that they range from 0 to 100.

\subsection{Overview}
There are four key parts to our methods.  First we generate a labeled set of training images.  Second we use a model of the early visual system the compute the responses of the cone photoreceptor mosaic to the labeled images. Third we apply AMA to the cone responses to learn task-optimal receptive fields (RFs). Fourth we evaluate how well the responses of the RFs may be decoded to achieve luminance constancy.

\subsubsection{Virtual naturalistic scenes}

The light that reflects from objects to the eyes depends on many factors.
These include the surface reflectance, texture, material and geometry of the objects, the spectra of the illuminants, and the position of the observer.
We developed a rendering package (\href{https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldColorConstancy}{Virtual World Color Constancy}, \href{http://rendertoolbox.org}{RenderToolbox4} \cite{heasly2014rendertoolbox3}) that allows us to construct models of naturalistic scenes, with key scene factors under programmatic control.
The package harnesses an open-source computer graphics renderer  \cite{jakob2015mitsuba} to produce physically-accurate images from the scene models.
Because each image is rendered from a known scene model, each image pixel can be labeled with the surface reflectance of the corresponding scene object.
By incorporating statistical models of the variation of object surface reflectance and daylight illumination, the pipeline allows us to produce large labeled sets of images that capture much of the task-relevant statistical structure of natural scenes.

\caption{{\bf Library base scene with inserted objects.} The rendering package was used to insert different objects into the library base scene, with each panel showing a different object. The objects were inserted at a location in the image and then the camera was pointed at the object, so that the object's image is at the center of the rendered image.  In the figure panels, the full rendered image is cropped so that the inserted object is more visually salient. We use this capability of our software pipeline to insert target objects into scenes.}\label{fig:libraryWithTarget}
\end{figure}

Our rendering package includes a collection of base scenes (Fig.~\ref{fig:baseScenes}).
Base scenes specify an arrangement of objects and light sources.
Base scenes may be enriched by the insertion of additional objects, chosen from an object library (Fig.~\ref{fig:libraryWithTarget}).
Once the position, size and pose of the inserted objects has been set, our package allows the assignment of a surface reflectance function to each object in the scene and a spectral power distribution to each light source (Fig.~\ref{fig:VWCCTransformations}).
This provides a complete scene model which can be rendered from any specified viewpoint.

In the present work, we used our package to generate datasets of naturalistic scenes and corresponding images.
We used one fixed base scene and inserted a target object of fixed shape and size into this scene.
We generated five distinct datasets: Conditions 0 through 4.
Across these datasets the luminance constancy problem, estimating the target object LRV,
becomes progressively more difficult (Fig.~\ref{fig:studiedCases}).
Each dataset consisted of 1000 scenes and corresponding images.

In Condition 0, the only source of stimulus variation was in the task relevant quantity, the target object LRV.
Here, we fixed target object color (i.e. the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object),
the reflectance spectra of the background objects, and the spectral power distributions of the light sources.
We used 10 LRV values, equally spaced between 20 and 60.
Condition 0 defines a baseline. In this condition, all images with the the same value of the LRV are identical.

In the remaining conditions, we systematically introduced variation in scene factors other than the target object LRV.
In Condition 1, we introduced variation in target object color but held the other factors fixed.

Conditions 2, 3 and 4 each increase the variation relative to Condition 1.
In Condition 2, in addition to the color of the target object,
we varied the reflectance spectra of the background objects
while holding the the spectral power distribution of the light sources
constant.
In Condition 3, in addition to the color of the target object,
we varied the spectral power distribution of the light sources
while holding the reflectance spectra of the background objects constant.
Finally, in Condition 4 we varied all three factors (target object color,
reflectance spectra of the background objects, spectral power distribution of the light sources).
The variation within our datasets captures the essence of the computational problem of lightness constancy
up to effects of scene geometry, an additional richness that we do not address in this paper.

For the primary results, we used the ``{\it Library}'' base scene and a spherical target object .
The library base scene contains X area lights. We inserted one additional spherical spherical light source into the scene.
The position and size of the inserted object, inserted light source and viewpoint were held fixed across all scenes in the database,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:3DScene}.
Surface and illuminant spectra were drawn according to statistical models of naturally occurring spectra.
We describe these models below.
Multispectral images ($320 \times 240$ pixels) were rendered at 31 evenly-spaced wavelengths between $400$nm and $700$nm.

\end{figure}

To generate illumination spectra, we developed a statistical model of the \href{http://colorimaginglab.ugr.es/pages/Data}{Granada daylight measurements} \cite{hernandez2001color} and sample randomly from the model.
The overall intensity of the measurements spans approximately three orders of magnitude.
Figure~\ref{fig:granadaData} plots the measurements in normalized form to make apparent the variation in the relative spectra. The spectra are normalized by their mean over wavelength.

Our statistical model approximates these normalized shapes using their first 6 principle components, and models the variation in these components with
a 6-dimensional Gaussian whose mean and covariance matrix match the dataset's sample mean and covariance of the weights on these components \cite{BrainardFreeman}.
To generate a random relative illuminant spectrum, we take a draw from this Gaussian to obtain weights and generate the corresponding spectrum.
Figure~\ref{fig:illuminantSamples} illustrates the relative spectra of draws obtained using this procedure.
Details of the statistical model for illumination are provided in the appendix.

Because our multivariate Gaussian model is based on the rescaled spectra, it does not embody the large variation in overall intensity of natural daylights.
To obtain illuminant spectra with intensity variation similar to the Granada dataset, we scaled each randomly generated relative spectrum.
We obtained each scale factor by randomly sampling (with replacement) a spectrum from the Granda dataset and taking its mean. 
Color swatches of samples of illuminant spectra are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sRGBIlluminant}.

We generated random reflectance spectra using the same principles we applied to generate random illuminant spectra.
We combined the Munsell \cite{kelly1943tristimulus} and Vrhel \cite{vrhel1994measurement} surface reflectance 
measurements to create a database containing 632 reflectance spectra Figure~\ref{fig:reflectanceSpectra}.
The Munsell database contains 462 spectra each measured at 5nm sampling intervals between 380nm and 780nm.
The Vrhel dataset contains 170 spectra measured at 2nm sampling between 390nm and 730 nm.
We resampled these spectra to 31 evenly-spaced wavelengths between $400$nm and $700$nm.
Figure~\ref{fig:reflectanceSpectra} illustrates the spectra of draws obtained using this procedure.
Details of the statistical model for surface reflectance spectra are provided in the appendix. 

For generating the target object reflectance at a particular luminance $(Y_{\rm T})$, the values in a generated spectrum were 
scaled such that the LRV had the desired value (see appendix).
Figure \ref{fig:targetSwatches} shows color swatches of target reflectance spectra rendered under CIE illuminant D65, for evenly spaced LRV values.

\subsection{Model of early visual system} \label{method:Isetbio}

The light entering the eye is blurred by the eye's optics.
The resulting retinal image is sampled by a mosaic of cone photoreceptors.
The responses of these photoreceptors provide the information about the scene that is available to the neural visual system for further processing.
Because we are interested in how well luminance constancy may be achieved by the human visual system, we simulated the cone responses
to our scenes using a model of the early visual system.

We focussed our analysis on regions of the image local to the target by cropping the rendered images to $1 \times 1$ degrees of visual angle around the target object ($51 \times 51$ pixels; Figure~\ref{fig:croppedImage}).
This choice is motivated by the observation that neural receptive fields early in the visual pathways (e.g., retina, primary visual cortex) pool information locally.
In foveal primary visual cortex, receptive fields have a spatial extent of approximately 1 degree of visual angle (REFS).
% Johannes to provide his favorite citation or two.  Some review.

We modeled a visual system with a pupil diameter of 3 mm, optical blurring (including axial chromatic aberration) in the formation of the retinal image (REF whatever optics model), spatial sampling by an interleaved mosaic of long (L), middle (M)  and short (S) wavelength-sensitive cones (Brainard mosaic review; Fig.~\ref{fig:croppedImageWithMosaic}). The cone mosaic contained  L:M:S cones in the ratio 0.6:0.3:0.1 and with spectral sensitivities derived from the CIE physiological standard (REF).
Cone isomerizations were computed assuming an integration time of 5 msec, and we modeled the Poisson nature of photopigment isomerization (REF Hecht et al). This modeling was implemented using the software infrastructure provided by ISETBio (REF).

The cone isomerizations represent the first step of visual processing.
To capture key properties of post-receptoral processing, such as contrast normalization \cite{heeger1992normalization,albrecht1991motion,carandini2012normalization},
we processed the isomerizations as follows:
First, we generated a response for each cone class at each pixel in the sampled retinal image, using bilinear interpolation separately for each cone class.
This gives us a cone response image for each cone class.
We also normalized each cone response image by the total area under the corresponding cone spectral sensitivity.
This makes the magnitude of the cone response images similar across cone classes.
These two processing steps do not alter the information in the cone response images. 

To model contrast coding, we converted each cone response image to a corresponding cone contrast image.
This was accomplished by computing the mean response over the three cone contrast images, and then subtracting off and dividing by this mean.
To model contrast normalization, we divided by the sum of squared contrasts over image pixels and cone classes.

\subsection{Computational luminance constancy} \label{method:SupervisedLearning}
We used our datasets to determine how well target object LRV can be estimated from cone responses and from normalized cone contrasts.
Studying both representations allows us to understand how early contrast coding and normalization affect how well luminance constancy can be achieved.
We applied accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) to learn the optimal receptive fields for estimating LRV,
and evaluated the performance obtained when the output of these filters was optimally decoded.

\subsubsection*{Learning optimal filters}
AMA is a task specific Bayesian method for dimensionality reduction.
When provided with a labeled training set, a receptive field response model, a decoder that uses these responses to estimate the stimulus label, and a cost function, AMA returns a set of linear receptive fields.
Given a set of linear receptive fields and an explicit cost function, it is possible to determine the minimum-expected-cost estimator that maps responses to stimulus labels given the training set and the 
assumption that all images in the training set are equally likely.
Moreover, the corresponding expected estimation cost may be explicitly computed.
AMA searches over the space of linear receptive fields to find the set that minimizes the expected estimation cost.
Here we used squared error as the cost function and assumed that receptive field responses were corrupted by scaled Gaussian noise (i.e. Poisson-like noise with a fano factor of 1.3).
Details of how AMA learns filters and the filter responses are optimally decoded are provided in previously published work \cite{geisler2009optimal,burge2017accuracy,jaini2017linking}.

\subsubsection*{Decoding optimal filters}

Once the optimal receptive fields have been learned, we need to develop a general decoder that can be applied to arbitrary test stimuli.
A general decoder is necessary because the decoder used to learn the receptive fields requires the response mean and response variance of the filters to every labelled stimulus in the training set \cite{geisler2009optimal,burge2017accuracy}.
To proceed, first we use the AMA optimal receptive fields and the training dataset to find the conditional distributions of the receptive field responses, conditioned on the labelled target object LRVs.
Then, we approximate these with multivariate Gaussian distributions.
With the Gaussian approximation in hand, 
to estimate the LRV of the target object in a test image, we use Bayes' rule to obtain the posterior distribution over LRV values given the filter responses.
The optimal estimate is the LRV value that minimizes the expected value of the cost function, where the expectation is taken over the posterior.

\subsubsection*{Baseline methods}

To provide baselines for evaluation of the estimation method described above, we used linear regression.
First, we solved for the weights on the average L, M and S cone responses target object that best predicted the target LRV values.
We took the average cone respones from a $3 \times 3$ region at the center of the target object.
This baseline method disregards information carried the image regions corresponding to the background objects.
We also performed regression on the contrast normalized version of the cone responses.
This baseline method indirectly incorporates information carried the image regions corresponding to the background objects,
through their effect on the contrast normalized responses from the target object. 
We also evaluated the performance of a naive model that estimate the mean of the LRV values in the training set, irrespective
of the image data.

%\subsection{Performance evaluation}
%
%To evaluate the performance of our luminance constancy methods, we generated test sets as new random draws from our statistical models.
%For each test image, we quant we summarized performance as the relative mean squared estimation error.
%If $\hat{Y}$ is the estimated luminance corresponding to the assigned luminance $Y$, the error of the luminance estimates is quantified as the relative error ($E_{\rm rel}$) defined as: $E_{\rm rel}^2 = \left\langle\left((\hat{Y}-Y)/Y\right)^2\right\rangle$.

\section{Results} \label{Results}

We start with Condition 1, where only the LRV and relative reflectance spectrum of the target object vary across scenes.
For this condition, estimating LRV should be easy because the variation in target object reflectance that we introduced
preserved LRV (which is calculated using a CIE D65 as the illumination).
This in turn means that for fixed scene illuminants similar to D65, the luminance of the light reflected from the target object will vary minimally.
In Condition 1, we used an illumination draw form our daylight sample and thus expect a reasonable degree of similarity to D65.

We used AMA to learn a set of linear receptive fields that are optimal for estimating target LRV for this condition.
For this condition, we trained and evaluated AMA on the cone responses to the image patches.
Figure~\ref{fig:case1RFResponse} shows the responses of the first two receptive fields to all the image patches in the training set.
Each individual point represents the receptive field responses to a single image patch.
Each point is color coded according to the LRV corresponding to the target object in the patch.
The responses segregate according to the target LRV.
This means that the responses may be used to accurately decode LRV, confirming the intuition that computational
luminance constancy is readily achieved for Condition 1.

Decoding performance for the test set is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:case1Results}.
As expected, the LRV estimates obtained by decoding the AMA receptive field responses are veridical.
Figure~\ref{fig:case1Results} also shows the performance of the baseline linear regression method, again trained
on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
For this condition, linear regression on the target object cone responses also leads to veridical LRV estimates.

\label{fig:Condition1}
\end{figure}

Next we discuss Condition 2, where we varied the spectral power distribution function of the light sources in addition to the target object LRV and relative spectrum. 
This is a more realistic condition, where the spectra of light sources change while the objects remain fixed, as in a naturalistic scene. 
Similar to condition 1, we used AMA to learn a set of linear receptive fields that are optimal for estimating target LRV for this condition.
First we trained and evaluated AMA on the cone responses to the image patches.
Figure~\ref{fig:isomerizationFails} shows the responses of the first two receptive fields to all the image patches in the training set.
For the spectral variations of condition 2, the AMA receptive fields learnt on the cone response to the images does a very poor job in predicting the target LRV.
This is because, since the illuminant spectra varies in this condition, the photoreceptor response is not directly proportional to the target object surface anymore. 
The decoding performance using these receptive fields for the test set is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:IsomerizationResults}.

On the other hand, since the background surfaces are fixed in this condition, the ratio between the response of  photoreceptors corresponding to the target object and the background remains proportional to the target LRV. 
This is because a change in illuminant spectra produces the same effect in both the target object and the background object. 
Thus, the AMA receptive fields learnt on the contrast normalized cone response (see Methods) can be used to predict the target LRV (Fig.~\ref{fig:contrastWorks}). 
Fig.~\ref{fig:contrastResults} shows the decoding performance for the test set in condition 2 obtained using the contrast normalized representation.
AMA receptive fields provide excellent predictions of the target LRV. 
The predictions are much better compared to that of a linear model that only considers the (contrast normalized) response of the photoreceptors corresponding to the center pixel of the target object.

Finally, we discuss Condition 3, where the spectral power distribution function of the light sources, the reflectance spectra of the background objects and the target object LRV and relative spectrum are allowed to vary. 
This is the most interesting and difficult condition.
For this condition, we used AMA to learn a set of linear receptive fields using the contrast normalized cone response. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:contrastResults} shows the decoding performance for the test set in condition 3 obtained using the contrast normalized representation.

    \label{fig:case12AllResults}
\end{figure}

Condition 4 is the most complex type of variation that we consider in this work. Here we allow all three types of spectra to change from image to image. In this condition, neither the photoreceptor response (as in condition 1 and 2), nor any simple transformation of the response (condition 3) can provide the target LRV.We used AMA to learn the receptive fields using the contrast normalized cone photoreceptor response from stimuli in condition 4. Fig.~\ref{fig:case12AllResults} shows the AMA receptive field response and the luminance estimates for the images in condition 4. 
We have used the first 8 receptive fields to estimate the luminance in this condition (see Fig.\ref{fig:ErrorVsNFilters}). 
The AMA receptive fields do an excellent job of predicting the target LRV. 
The estimates are unbiased with the mean estimates lying close the diagonal unit slope line (Fig.~\ref{fig:case12Results}). 
The relative error of estimation is $\sim15\%$, which low compared to that of the naive model ($\sim42\%$) or the linear model on center pixel ($\sim21\%$).

 \label{fig:AMAFilters}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:AMAFilters} shows the first two AMA receptive fields that are optimal for estimating the target LRV for the four types of spectral variations studied in this work. The receptive fields are ranked in ascending order of the value of the cost function associated with them. Thus the first RF corresponds to the direction along which the projection of the data gives the minimum cost. The L, M and S components give the weights for the linear sum of the cone responses for the three cone types. The salient features are: the center surround structure of the RFs and the higher weights of the L and M cones, compared to the S cones. 

For condition 1, since the illuminant and the background are fixed, all the information is in the central target object reflectance. Thus, the RFs weights are mostly concentrated around the center. For condition 2, where the target and the background spectra varies, most of the luminance information is still concentrated around the central target object. For condition 3, while the target and the illuminant spectra varies, the background object spectra is fixed. Hence, the luminance can be estimated by simply from the contrast between the response of the cones corresponding to the target and the background. Thus, while the RFs show a trend of weights concentrated at the center similar to condition 1, there is large negative contribution from the surround. The spatial features of the RFs are due the stereotypical geometry of the images (see \nameref{Methods}). Condition 4 has a similar center surround structure, but with more prominent features of the background since the spectra of the background objects are also varying. Again, the spatial features are a result of the stereotypical geometry of the images.

\subsection{The receptive fields of complex condition generalize on simpler conditions}
Fig.~\ref{fig:barGraphs} shows the relative error for the estimates of the target LRV obtained using the linear model and AMA. We show the relative error of the estimates obtained using the AMA receptive fields from all conditions. The receptive fields from a more complex condition perform at par on the stimuli from a simpler condition. The optimal AMA estimates are better than that of the linear model.

\section{Discussion} \label{Discussion}
In this paper, we studied luminance constancy using naturalistic images. We used a software pipeline called  Virtual world color constancy (VWCC), which was developed for this work, to generate datasets of multispectral images labeled by the luminance of a target object in each image. VWCC creates 2D multispectral images of 3D scenes based on information provided by the user. Such information include the shape of the 3D space, the shape, size, position and material properties of the objects and light sources in the scene. In our work, we assigned these geometrical and spectral properties using random sampling from available databases of natural objects and light sources. Thus, we generated a large database of labeled hyper-spectral images, with naturalistic scene properties, where we have the ground truth information about every surface and light source. Such databases, of even a few images, are nearly impossible to obtain for natural scenes. This is because it is very hard to measure the surface reflectance and the illumination spectrum at every point in a scene, even for well controlled lab environments. 

We used the software generated labeled images in a supervised manner to understand luminance constancy under four types of spectral manipulations (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}-Fig.~\ref{fig:studiedCases}). We found that target LRV can be recovered through simple manipulation of the retinal cone responses for cases where the spectral manipulations are restricted to at most two of the three possible sources of manipulations: the target object surface reflectance, the background object surface reflectances, or the light source illumination spectra. When variations are allowed only in the target object surface reflectance spectrum, or only the target object and the background objects surface reflectance spectra, the luminance can be estimated directly from the response of retinal cone photoreceptors. If the background spectra is fixed, but the target object reflectance spectrum and the light source illumination spectra are varying, the luminance can be obtained from the contrast between the cone response corresponding to the target and the background. When all three spectral variations are allowed simultaneously, one needs additional information to obtain the target LRV.

% MOVE THIS TO DISCUSSION
%This general approach has been adopted by other labs for the study of computational estimation of optical flow (Baker et al., 2011) and is becoming increasingly popular (Kovacs, Bell, Snavely, & Bala, 2017), as well as for the generation of stimuli for the study of human perception (e.g., Boyaci, Maloney, & Hersh, 2003; Todd & Mingolla, 1983; Arend & Reeves, 1986; Johnston, Cumming, & Parker, 1993). Of course, success within the domain of graphics images does not guarantee smooth generalization to real natural images, a point we return to in the Discussion.

% NOT SURE WE NEED ANY OF THIS.  PROBABLY NOT HERE IF WE DO
%Even within the special case of luminance constancy, there are many scene manipulations that could be considered. The set of manipulations we focus on here are illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure} and the three panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:studiedCases}. These conditions are: 1. variation in target object spectrum with fixed light source and background objects spectra (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}), 2. variation in target object spectrum and background objects spectra, with fixed light source  (Fig.~\ref{fig:backgroundVarying}), 3. variations in both the target object spectrum and the light source spectra, with fixed background object spectra (Fig.~\ref{fig:targetIlluminantVarying}), and 3. variations in all three types of spectra (target object, light source, and background objects) (Fig.~\ref{fig:allSpectraVarying}). Across real scenes, there will also be variations in the shape of the target object, its pose, eye position, etc. (see \nameref{Methods}). In this paper, we focus on the problem of luminance constancy within scene ensembles where these geometric factors are held fixed.
%
%We show that for conditions that have spectral variation only either in target object surface reflectance or background object surface reflectance or the power spectrum of the light sources, luminance can be estimated by simple transformations of the cone responses. For variations only in target object reflectance spectra (Condition 1) or just the target and background objects reflectance spectra (Condition 2), LRV can be recovered directly from the light reflected off the target object. For Condition 3, where both the target object reflectance and light source spectra vary, LRV can be recovered from the contrast between the target and the background. When all the spectral features in the scene are allowed to change (Condition 4), the standard luminance can not be recovered simply from the cone response or the contrast. We have used AMA with a Bayesian estimator to estimate standard luminance of the target object. Using this method, we can recover the luminance of the target object with $\sim 15\%$ relative root mean square error.  Our analysis shows that the optimal receptive fields for estimating the luminance of the target object show a center surround structure, supporting a comparison between the light coming from the target object and its surround. Additionally, luminance estimation involves a weighted sum of the L, M and S cone responses where the receptive fields give more weight to the L and M cone responses compared to S cone responses. Comparing the performance of the RFs learnt using  one condition on the cone response of other conditions shows that the receptive field of the complex conditions perform well on images of simpler conditions. We discuss the implications of such receptive fields on luminance constancy.
