\section{Introduction}
The perceived color of an object has important behavioral implications because color helps to identify objects and their surface properties \cite{Mollon89, Jacobs81}.
The computational challenge underlying object color perception is that the light reflected from an object depends not just on the object's surface reflectance, but also 
on object-extrinsic factors such as the scene illumination, the pose of the object, and the viewpoint of the observer in the scene (Fig.~\ref{fig:introSchematic}).
To compute a perceptual representation of object color that is correlated with the object's physical surface reflectance, the visual system must account for these object-extrinsic factors.
The ability of a visual system to compute a representation of object color that is stable against variation in object-extrinsic factors is called color constancy. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although human color constancy is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A well-studied special case of color constancy is when the stimuli are restricted to be achromatic. 
This special case is called lightness constancy \cite{gilchrist2006seeing}. 
Although human lightness and color constancy are }\DIFaddend not perfect, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they are }\DIFaddend often very good \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\cite{FosterColorConstancy, BrainardColorConstancy}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\cite{FosterColorConstancy, BrainardColorConstancy,adelson2000,kingdom2011lightness}}\DIFaddend . 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The computational problem of color constancy may be framed as how to obtain stable descriptions of the spectral surface reflectance functions of the objects in a scene.
}\DIFaddend Early work on computational color constancy considered a simplified imaging model where scenes consisted of multiple flat matte objects and a single spatially diffuse illuminant \cite{LandRetinex,Buchsbaum80,MaloneyWandell86}.
Subsequent work incorporated probabilistic descriptions of the statistics of naturally occurring scenes \cite{D'ZmuraConstancy3, D'ZmuraIversonSinger,BrainardFreeman}.
A key insight from these computational studies is that stable color descriptors of a target object cannot be obtained solely from the light reflected from that target object.
It is possible, however, to obtain stable color descriptors by jointly analyzing the light reflected from multiple objects in the scene.
As a consequence, color constancy will be affected both by variation in the illumination and by variation in the surface reflectance of other objects in the scene.  Color constancy algorithms should therefore be evaluated with respect to variation in both of these factors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\cite{BrainardWandellRetinex,BrainardFreeman}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\cite{brainard1986analysis,BrainardFreeman}}\DIFaddend .

The reflected light also depends on geometric factors, such as the object's shape, pose, and position. 
The human visual system accounts for variations in reflected light due to object-extrinsic factors and produces a percept of object color that is relatively stable across such variations.

Specifically, we study variation in target object relative surface reflectance, variation in illumination spectrum, and variation in the surface reflectance of the other objects in the scene.}

Recently, supervised statistical learning methods have been applied to the computational problem of color constancy.
These methods use the joint statistics of labeled images and scene variables to learn mappings that extract stable surface color descriptors from image input \cite{barron2015convolutional}.
This general approach has been useful for other perceptual problems in early and mid-level vision.
For example, a recently developed technique called accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) learns linear receptive fields optimized for particular perceptual tasks \cite{geisler2009optimal,burge2017accuracy,jaini2017linking}. AMA has been used to develop ideal observers for estimating defocus blur, binocular disparity, and retinal motion estimation with natural stimuli. These ideal observers provide excellent predictions of human performance \cite{burge2011optimal, burge2012optimal, burge2014optimal, burge2015optimal}.

Supervised learning requires large labeled datasets. Such datasets are not readily available for the study of color constancy. Although there are datasets of calibrated color images, these do not provide ground truth information about surface reflectance and illumination at each image location \cite{ChakrabartiHyperspectral,NascimentoFoster2016,ParragaHyperspectralData,TkacikUpennHypersepctralData,skauli2013collection,olmos2004biologically}. There are a few databases consisting of images of posed scenes where surface reflectances of individual objects have been measured (\citeNP{funt1988color,ciurea2003large}), but these databases are not large enough to drive supervised learning. Finally, recent work has applied crowd-sourcing techniques to annotate natural images with surface reflectance descriptors \cite{bell2014intrinsic}.

In this paper, we use high-quality computer graphics to generate large datasets of naturalistic images where the surface reflectance corresponding to each image pixel is known. 
This approach allows us to investigate computational color constancy with naturalistic stimuli, while retaining the ability to control the properties of objects and illuminants. We tackle the specific problem of luminance constancy, a constitutive component of the more general color constancy problem (Fig.~\ref{fig:introExampleFigure}). 

We define the computational problem of luminance constancy as that of estimating the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{light reflectance value (LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{luminous reflectance factor (LRF}\DIFaddend ) of a target object's surface reflectance function\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
The LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \footnote{\DIFadd{In the literature, the term lightness constancy is generally used to denote color constancy for the special case when stimuli are restricted to be achromatic. This condition does not apply to our work - we consider full spectral variation in the stimuli. We chose the term luminance constancy to denote the generalization from achromatic stimuli, while at the same time acknowledging that we are not studying the full problem of color constancy but rather the estimation of a luminance-based summary of surface spectral reflectance.}}\DIFadd{.
The LRF }\DIFaddend is a measure of the overall amount of light reflected by a surface \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\cite{astm1121477}.
Estimating the LRV from a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{luminance of the reference illuminant itself}\footnote{\DIFadd{LRF is related to albedo, but the concept of albedo does not incorporate the human luminosity function.}} \DIFadd{\cite{astm1121477}.
Obtaining the LRF from a known }\DIFaddend surface reflectance function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{proceeds in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{requires }\DIFaddend two steps.
First, one computes the luminance of the light that would be reflected from the surface under a reference illuminant.
Second, one normalizes the result by the luminance of the reference illuminant itself.
Here we use CIE daylight D65 as the reference illuminant and the CIE 1931 photopic luminosity function to compute luminance \cite{CIE86}.
Sometimes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRVs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRFs }\DIFaddend are expressed as a percentage.
Here we express \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRVs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRFs }\DIFaddend as proportions, so that they take on values between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0 and 1.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.0 and 1.0. 
An LRF of 0.0 means that none of the light from the reference illuminant is reflected from the surface. 
An LRF of 1.0 means that all of the light from the reference illuminant is reflected from the surface.

\subsection{Overview}
There are four key steps to our methods.  First, we generate a labeled set of training images.  Second, we use a model of the early visual system to compute the responses of the cone photoreceptor mosaic to the labeled images. Third, we apply AMA to the cone responses, as well as to a contrast normalized version of the cone responses, to learn task-optimal receptive fields (RFs). Fourth, we evaluate how well the responses of the RFs may be decoded to achieve luminance constancy.

\subsection{Labeled training data} \label{method:VirtualWorld}
\subsubsection{Virtual naturalistic scenes}
The light that reflects from objects to the eyes depends on many factors.
These include the surface reflectance, texture, material and geometry of the objects, 
the spectral power distribution of the illuminants, and the position of the observer.
We have developed a rendering package 
(\href{https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldColorConstancy}{https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldColorConstancy}) 
that allows us to construct models of naturalistic scenes, with key scene factors under programmatic control.
The package builds on the RenderToolbox4 package (\href{http://rendertoolbox.org}{http://rendertoolbox.org}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) \cite{heasly2014rendertoolbox3}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; \citeNP{heasly2014rendertoolbox3})}\DIFaddend ,
and harnesses the open-source computer graphics renderer Mitsuba (\href{https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org}{https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org}, 
\citeNP{jakob2015mitsuba}) to produce physically-accurate images from the scene models.
Because the images are rendered from known scene models, each image pixel can be labeled with 
the surface reflectance of the corresponding object.
By using statistical models of daylight illumination and object surface reflectance to guide the rendering of scenes, 
the package allows us to produce large labeled sets of images that capture key aspects of the task-relevant 
statistical structure of natural scenes.

\end{figure}

The RenderToolbox4 package includes a collection of base scenes (Fig.~\ref{fig:baseScenes}).
Base scenes specify an arrangement of objects and light sources.
Base scenes may be enriched by the insertion of additional objects, chosen from an object library (Fig.~\ref{fig:libraryWithTarget}), and by the insertion of additional light sources.
Once the position, size, and pose of the inserted objects and light sources have been set, 
a surface reflectance function can be assigned to each object in the scene, and a spectral power distribution function can be assigned to each light source (Fig.~\ref{fig:VWCCTransformations}). The resulting scene model can then be rendered from any specified viewpoint.

In the present work, we used our package to generate datasets of naturalistic scenes and corresponding images.
We used one fixed base scene and inserted a spherical target object of fixed size into this scene.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{All surfaces in the scene model were matte and did not have specularities.
There were multiple light sources in the scene, and the rendering process simulated shadows as well as mutual reflection of light between nearby surfaces.
}\DIFaddend We generated three distinct datasets, which we refer to as Conditions 1-3 (Fig.~\ref{fig:studiedCases}). These are described below.
Across these datasets the luminance constancy problem (i.e. estimating the target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend )
becomes progressively more difficult.

The variation within our datasets captures the essence of the computational problem of lightness constancy
up to effects of scene geometry, an additional richness that we do not address in this paper (see \citeNP{funt1988color, barron2012color}).

In Condition 1, the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object was the only source of scene variation other than the target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
The reflectance spectra of the background objects and the spectral power distribution of the light sources were held fixed.
In Condition 2, the spectral power distribution of the light sources varied in addition to the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object.
Finally, in Condition 3 three distinct scene factors--target object relative reflectance spectrum, spectral power distribution of the light sources, and reflectance spectra of the background objects
--varied in addition to the target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
The datasets for Conditions 1 and 2 consisted of 1000 scenes and images, 100 for each of 10 target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values. 
The dataset for Condition 3 consisted of 3000 scenes and images, 300 each for the 10 target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values.
The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values were equally spaced between 0.2 and 0.6.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For each LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{More than 90\% of the surface reflectance spectra (generated as described below) fell within this range.
For each LRF }\DIFaddend value, we generated a different relative target object surface reflectance for each scene.

\subsubsection{Illumination spectra}
To generate illumination spectra, we developed a statistical model of the Granada daylight measurements (\citeNP{hernandez2001color}; \href{http://colorimaginglab.ugr.es/pages/Data}{http://colorimaginglab.ugr.es/pages/Data}) and then sampled randomly from the model.
To match the wavelength spacing we use in rendering, we resampled the wavelength spacing of the Granada spectra to
31 evenly-spaced wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm.

\end{figure}

Our statistical model approximates normalized spectra from the Granada dataset using the first 6 principle components of the normalized measurements from that dataset.
The variation in the weights on these components is then modeled with a 6-dimensional Gaussian.
The mean and covariance matrix of the Gaussian match the sample mean and covariance of the weights \cite{BrainardFreeman}. 
To generate a random relative illuminant spectrum, we sample weights randomly from this Gaussian and then perform a weighted sum of the components to generate the corresponding spectrum.
Figure~\ref{fig:illuminantSamples} illustrates the relative spectra of draws obtained using this procedure.
Chromaticities and rendered color renditions of these draws are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:xyDiagram} and ~\ref{fig:sRGBIlluminant}.
Details of the statistical model for illumination are provided in the appendix.

The multivariate Gaussian model described above is based on normalized spectra. 
Thus, it does not embody the large variation in overall intensity of natural daylights.
To restore the overall intensity variation in the Granada dataset, which spans approximately three orders of magnitude, we scaled each randomly generated spectrum with a random number sampled from a log-uniform distribution spanning three orders of magnitude.
The particular range of scale factors was chosen so that the mean number of cone isomerizations from the target object ranged from approximately 100 to 100,000, given a 100 ms cone integration time (see below).
This range of cone isomerizations corresponds approximately to that of natural daylight viewing.

To generate random reflectance spectra, we employed principles similar to those used to generate random illuminant spectral power distributions.
We used measurements from the Munsell \cite{kelly1943tristimulus} and Vrhel \cite{vrhel1994measurement} surface reflectance datasets to create a dataset containing 632 reflectance spectra (462 from the Munsell data and 170 from the Vrhel data\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend Figure~\ref{fig:reflectanceSpectra}).
We resampled the spectra to 31 evenly-spaced wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm.
Figures~\ref{fig:reflectanceSamples},~\ref{fig:xyChroReflectance}, and~\ref{fig:backgroundSwatches} illustrate reflectance sampled obtained using the model. 
Details of the statistical model for surface reflectance spectra are provided in the appendix.

\subsection{Model of early visual system} \label{method:Isetbio}
Light entering the eye is focussed and blurred by eye's optics to form the retinal image.
This image is then sampled by a mosaic of cone photoreceptors.
The excitations of these photoreceptors provide the information available to the neural visual system for further processing.
Because we are interested in how well luminance constancy may be achieved by the human visual system, we simulated the cone excitations
to our scenes using a model of the early visual system.

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{focussed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{focused }\DIFaddend our analysis on image regions local to the target by cropping the rendered images to $1 \times 1$ degrees of visual angle around the target object ($51 \times 51$ pixels; Figure~\ref{fig:croppedImage}).
The local analysis is motivated by the fact that neural receptive fields early in the visual pathways (e.g., retina, primary visual cortex) pool information locally. 
In primary visual cortex, foveal receptive fields have a maximum spatial extent of approximately 1 degree of visual angle \cite{gattass1981visual, gattass1988visuotopic}. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We sought to understand how well responses from AMA-learned receptive fields at a similar scale could be used to achieve luminance constancy.
}\DIFaddend 

We modeled a visual system having typical optical blurring (including axial chromatic aberration\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)\cite{marimont1994matching}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, \citeNP{marimont1994matching})}\DIFaddend , and typical spatial sampling with an interleaved rectangular mosaic of long (L), middle (M)  and short (S) wavelength-sensitive cones (\citeNP{brainard2015color}; Fig.~\ref{fig:croppedImageWithMosaic}). 
The cone mosaic contained L:M:S cones in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approximately }\DIFaddend the ratio 0.6:0.3:0.1 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1523 L cones, 801 M cones, 277 S cones) }\DIFaddend and with spectral sensitivities derived from the CIE physiological standard \cite{CIE86}.
Cone excitations were taken as the number of photopigment isomerizations, assuming an integration time of 100 msec.

To put the computed cone excitations into a form for further analysis, we demosaiced the excitations for each cone class using linear interpolation
to obtain a cone excitation image for each cone class.
The lens and macular pigment absorb more short than long wavelength light, so that the excitations of the S cones tend to be
smaller than those of the L and M cones.
To make the magnitude of the three cone excitation images similar across cone classes, we
normalized each cone excitation image by the summed (over wavelength) quantal efficiency of the corresponding cone class.
The demosaicing and normalization do not alter the available information relative to that carried by the cone excitations themselves. 

To capture key properties of post-receptoral processing, such as contrast normalization \cite{heeger1992normalization,albrecht1991motion,carandini2012normalization}, 
we processed the cone excitation images as follows:
We first converted each cone excitation image to a corresponding cone contrast image.
This was accomplished by computing the mean response over the three cone excitation images, and then subtracting off and dividing by this mean.
To model contrast normalization, we then divided the contrast images by the sum of squared contrasts taken over image pixels and cone classes.

\subsection{Computational luminance constancy} \label{method:SupervisedLearning}
We used our datasets to determine how well target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend can be estimated from cone excitations and from normalized cone contrasts.
Studying both representations allows us to understand how early contrast coding and normalization affect luminance constancy.
We applied accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) to learn the optimal receptive fields for estimating \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend ,
and evaluated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the performance obtained }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{performance }\DIFaddend when the responses of these receptive fields are optimally decoded.

\subsubsection*{Learning optimal receptive fields}
AMA is a task-specific Bayesian method for dimensionality reduction.
When provided with a labeled training set, a receptive field response model, a decoder that uses these responses to estimate the stimulus label, and a cost function, AMA returns a set of N linear receptive fields, where N is a parameter of the procedure.
These receptive fields are chosen so that decoding their responses leads to minimum expected-cost estimation, relative to any other choice of N linear receptive fields.
This is possible because given a training set together with a set of N linear receptive fields and an explicit cost function, it is possible to determine the minimum expected-cost estimator that maps receptive field responses to the stimulus labels.
Moreover, a close approximation to the corresponding expected estimation cost may be explicitly computed.
Thus, AMA searches over the space of linear receptive fields to find the set that minimizes the expected estimation cost.
For each condition, we learned the receptive fields with a training set consisting of 90\% of the images.

In our implementation of AMA, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{explored }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend both the Kullback-Leibler divergence cost function (corresponding to the maximum a posteriori estimator) and the mean squared error cost function (corresponding to the posterior mean estimator) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to evaluate the accuracy of the AMA estimates of LRF. We also }\DIFaddend assumed that receptive field responses were corrupted by scaled Gaussian noise (i.e. Poisson-like noise with a fano factor of 1.3  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\citeNP{geisler1997visual}}\DIFaddend ). 
Training with both cost functions yielded similar estimation performance; the results reported here are for the Kullback-Leibler divergence cost function.
We chose this cost function because the estimates it yields at the boundaries of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend range are less biased than those obtained with the mean squared error cost function.

Details of how AMA learns receptive fields and how the receptive field responses are optimally decoded are provided in previously published work \cite{geisler2009optimal,burge2017accuracy,jaini2017linking}.

\subsubsection*{Decoding optimal receptive fields}

Once the AMA receptive fields have been learned, a general decoder is needed that can be used with arbitrary test images.
A general decoder is necessary because the decoder used to learn the receptive fields can be used only with the training set. Specifically, the decoder used to learn the receptive fields requires the response mean and response variance of each receptive field to every labelled stimulus in the training set \cite{geisler2009optimal,burge2017accuracy}.
To proceed, first we use the AMA receptive fields and the training dataset to find the distributions of the receptive field responses conditional on the target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRVs}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRFs}\DIFaddend .
Then, we model these conditional response distributions with multivariate Gaussians.
To estimate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend of the target object in a test image, we use Bayes' rule together with the Gaussian conditional distributions and a uniform prior to obtain the posterior distribution over \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values, given the receptive field responses.
The optimal estimate is the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend value that minimizes the expected value of the cost function, where the expectation is taken over the posterior.
For the results we report, we again used the Kullback-Leibler divergence cost function.

The Gaussian approximations for the posterior were estimated using the same training set that was used to learn the receptive fields.
Estimation performance was evaluated on a test set consisting of the 10\% of images in the dataset that were not in the training set.
For our primary results, estimation was based on six receptive fields.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The AMA analysis package is available at: }\href{https://github.com/BrainardLab/LuminanceConstancyAmaAnalysis}{https://github.com/BrainardLab/LuminanceConstancyAmaAnalysis}\DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection*{Baseline methods}
To provide baselines for evaluation of the estimation method described above, we used linear regression.
First, we solved for the weights on the average L, M and S cone excitations corresponding to the target object that best predicted the target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values.
We took the average cone responses from a $3 \times 3$ pixel region at the center of the target object.
This baseline method disregards information carried by the image regions corresponding to the background objects.
We also performed regression on the contrast normalized version of the cone excitation images.
This second baseline method indirectly incorporates information carried in the image regions corresponding to the background objects,
through their effect on the contrast normalized responses at the center of the target object. 
We also evaluated the performance of a naive model that uses the mean \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend value in the training set as the estimate, irrespective
of the image data; that is, the naive model always estimated the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend to be equal to 0.4.

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Quantifying estimation performance}}
\DIFadd{We quantified the performance of AMA and the baseline methods at estimating LRF through relative root mean squared error (relative RMSE). Relative RMSE is the square root of the mean of the squared difference between the estimated and true LRF divided by the true LRF. The mean is taken over all stimuli in the test set.

\subsection{Condition 1}
In Condition 1, only the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend and the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object vary across scenes.
We used accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) to learn a set of linear receptive fields that are optimal for estimating target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend from the cone excitations in this condition. 
Decoding performance is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:case1Estimates}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:case1Estimates} also shows the performance of the baseline linear regression method. 
Both methods are trained on 90\% of the images in the dataset and tested on the remaining 10\%.
The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend estimates obtained for both methods are essentially perfect.

Figure~\ref{fig:case1RFResponse} shows the responses of the first two AMA receptive fields to all the image patches in the training set.
Each individual point represents the receptive field responses to an individual image patch and
is color coded by target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
The responses segregate according to the target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend , which supports the high level 
of estimation performance shown in Figure~\ref{fig:case1Estimates}.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF
}\DIFaddend Note that even the responses of the first RF separate well (vertical lines would accurately
distinguish the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRVs}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRFs}\DIFaddend ), so that that one receptive field is sufficient for accurately performing the task.

Figure~\ref{fig:case1RFs} shows the first three AMA receptive fields.
Each receptive field performs a weighted sum of the L, M, and S cone excitations.
The L and M cone excitations at the target object location receive large weights.
The L and M cone excitations at the background object locations and the S cone excitations at all locations receive small weights and are thus largely ignored. 
For this condition, the background regions provide very little task-relevant information. 
In addition, luminance is primarily determined by L and M cones, so the S cones should make little
direct contribution.
The first three RFs are similar to each other, reflecting the fact that here the main benefit
of multiple receptive fields is to reduce the impact of noise on estimation performance.

The results in Figure~\ref{fig:Condition1} were obtained for one particular draw from our statistical model of illumination.
We verified that performance remained excellent for other draws.

\label{fig:Condition2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Condition 2}

Condition 2 includes variation in the spectral power distribution of the light sources, in addition to the variation present in Condition 1. 
This illumination variation makes the task more difficult because it causes variation in the cone excitations that is not due to target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend . 
We learned AMA receptive fields on the cone excitations to the images in this new condition, and again evaluated decoding performance (Fig.~\ref{fig:Condition2}(a,b)). 
Performance is poor.
Indeed, the estimates deviate considerably from the true \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend , as seen by the fact that the mean estimate
(red line) does not lie on the positive diagonal and by the fact that there is large estimation variability for each
value of the true \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
For this case, linear regression also does poorly. Indeed, the linear regression estimates are essentially the same as would be obtained
by simply guessing the mean \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend of the training set (0.4).

Recall that there are two qualitatively distinct factors contributing to the variation in illumination spectra: changes in overall intensity, and changes in the relative spectral power distribution. 
To separate the effect of these two factors, we trained and evaluated AMA on the contrast normalized cone excitations. 
By contrast normalizing the cone excitations, the contribution of overall intensity is essentially removed.
Figure~\ref{fig:Condition2}(c,d) shows that performance improves greatly with contrast normalization. 
Estimates obtained from the AMA receptive field responses are essentially perfect. 
Estimates obtained from linear regression are substantially improved.
This observation is consistent with previous results on computational color constancy that show that 
contrast-based representations are effective for supporting color constancy when only illumination spectra vary (e.g. \citeNP{land1986alternative}).
However, contrast-based representations are less effective at supporting constancy when the spectra of background objects in the scene vary (e.g. \citeNP{brainard1986analysis}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Condition 3}

Condition 3 introduces variation in the reflectance spectra of the background objects, in addition to the sources of variation in Conditions 1 and 2.
This condition models the sources of real-world spectral variation that are most relevant for the computational problem of luminance constancy.
We again trained and evaluated AMA for labeled image patches, using the contrast normalized cone excitations.
The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend estimates obtained via AMA are more variable and less accurate than for the previous conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:case3Estimates}).
Nevertheless, the estimates provide useful information about the target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
Indeed, the estimates track the true \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend on average, as seen by the fact that the mean estimate (red line) lies along the positive diagonal.
The increased estimation variability is indicated by the increased width of the shaded red region, relative to its width for the results of Condition 1 and 2.
Performance of the baseline linear regression method (also evaluated using contrast normalized cone excitations) is worse than that of the AMA-based estimates.

Figure~\ref{fig:case3RFResponse} shows the responses of the first two AMA receptive fields to the training stimuli.
Although the responses vary systematically with target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend , there is considerable overlap in the receptive field responses for stimuli having different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend values.
This overlap is due to the combined effect of the variation in the illumination and background surface spectra.
Recall, however, that the performance shown Figure~\ref{fig:case3Estimates} is based on six rather than two receptive fields;
there is likely to be less overlap in the full six-dimensional response space.
That is, inclusion of more receptive fields will in general reduce the ambiguity that is seen when we visualize the responses of just the first two receptive fields.
This effect is shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:RMSEvsRF}.
That figure also illustrates the effect of training set size on estimation performance.

The relative RMSE converges around 2000 images. To make this plot, the 300 image test set for Condition 3 was used in each case, while the training set size varied between 300 to 2700 images. The number of receptive fields used was varied between 1 and 6. (b) Same data as in panel a, but plotted as a function of number of receptive fields. Performance converges around 3 RFs. The error bars in each panel show +/- 1 SEM, with the variation taken across multiple runs with different random initializations for the numerical search used in our implementation of AMA.}
 \label{fig:RMSEvsRF}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:case3RFs} shows the first three receptive fields learned for Condition 3.
The first two are similar to the receptive fields for Condition 1, in that the L and M cone excitations receive large weights, while the S cone excitations are less heavily weighted.
In contrast to the Condition 1 RFs, there is also systematic contribution of cone excitations from background object locations, with both positive and negative contributions from background objects. 
The specific geometry of the receptive fields, however, should not be taken to be a strict prediction for receptive fields in the human visual system, as the particular RF geometry arises partly as a consequence of the fixed scene geometry used in the training set. 
Indeed, aspects of spatial structure of the training images can be seen in the RFs. 
Also, the third receptive field for Condition 3 places weight on the S cone excitations.
Although S cone signals do not contribute directly to luminance,  S cone responses are correlated with
L and M cone responses to natural spectra \cite{burton1987color, benson2014unsupervised}.
Information from the S cones can therefore contribute usefully to performance in the task. 
Finally, we note that there is some run-to-run variation in the structure of the optimal receptive fields that depends on the random initialization of the numerical search used in our implementation of AMA. 
(The cost landscape is not convex so local minima are possible.) 
However, such run-to-run RF variation leads only to very small changes in estimation error (see error bars in Figure~\ref{fig:RMSEvsRF}). 
Furthermore, even if the order varies somewhat, the same set of RFs tends to be learned.

Our rendering software allows us to compare the effect of background surface reflectances on target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend with and without simulation of secondary reflections of light from one object onto another. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Such }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These }\DIFaddend secondary reflections were \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulated for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{included in the dataset from which we report }\DIFaddend our primary results. 
When we turn off this feature of the rendering, we find (data not shown) that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that the secondary reflections have minimal effect on LRV estimation :
the estimates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF estimation performance is essentially unchanged. 
Estimates with and }\DIFaddend without secondary reflections \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were similarto those with reflections. 
This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are very similar. 
This result }\DIFaddend suggests that the primary source of the estimation error in Condition 3 is caused by image-to-image variation in the reflectance of the background objects\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
which in turn affects the normalized contrast representation of the target}\DIFdelend .

\section{Discussion} \label{Discussion}

\subsection{Summary}
In this paper, we studied luminance constancy using naturalistic images.
We used a software pipeline, which was developed for this work, to render datasets of multispectral images from scene descriptions.
Because we rendered the images, we could label each image in the dataset by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{light reflectance value (LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{luminous reflectance factor (LRF}\DIFaddend ) of the target object.
We used the labeled datasets to learn estimators for the target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
Across scenes, we varied the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend of the target object, the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object, 
the spectral power distributions of the light sources, and the reflectance spectra of the background objects in the scene.
These spectral variations were based on statistical models of natural surface reflectance spectra and natural illumination spectra.
We studied the how the performance of the learned estimators changed with systematic manipulation of the spectral variation in the datasets.

 \label{fig:barGraphs}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:barGraphs} summarizes our main findings, by showing the overall relative root mean squared estimation error (relative RMSE) for each condition. 
In Condition 1, where only the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object varies, 
luminance constancy is an easy computational problem,
and performance is essentially perfect for both the baseline linear regression and AMA methods.
In Condition 2, where the spectral power distribution of the illumination also varies, the problem of luminance constancy is more difficult.
Indeed, neither of our methods perform well when they operate directly on the cone excitations.
Performance with both methods improves greatly when the cone excitations are contrast normalized. 
Indeed, AMA performance for Condition 2 is essentially perfect, as it is in Condition 1.
Linear regression does less well, in part because it only has access to cone excitations at image locations
corresponding to the target object.
Condition 2, however, does not include scene-to-scene variation in the background surface reflectances,
as occurs in natural viewing.
The results for Condition 3 show performance when we add such variation.
Performance here represents the overall level of luminance constancy that our methods achieve for the
most realistic condition that we tested.
In this case, AMA-based estimates of target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend are, on average, within 13\% (relative RMSE) of the true value.
Introducing variation in the surface reflectance spectra of the background objects makes 
the luminance constancy problem substantially more difficult. 
Variation in the reflectance spectra of the background objects surfaces reduces how 
reliably light reflected from those objects can be used as a cue to estimate the spectral power distribution of the illuminant.

\subsection{Images of Virtual vs. Real Scenes}
As noted in the introduction, supervised learning requires large labeled datasets. Labeled datasets of natural images have been useful for developing normative models of the estimation of defocus blur, binocular disparity, retinal image motion, and 3D surface orientation \cite{burge2011optimal, burge2012optimal, burge2014optimal, burge2015optimal, sebastian2015defocus, kim2018lawful, burge2010natural, girshick2011cardinal, burge2016estimating, goncalves2017not}. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unfortunately, such datasets are not readily available for studying correlates of object surface reflectance.
To obtain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Large datasets of natural or posed scenes with }\DIFaddend ground truth information about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the reflectance of objects in a natural image, it is necessary to make 
an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{illuminant and object surface reflectance are difficult to obtain, as }\DIFaddend independent measurement of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the of the reflectance function of each object (or of the illumination impinging on each object). Although this can be done at a small number of image locations by inserting discretely spaced reflectance standards into the scene, 
interpolating to locations between such standards requires strong assumptions that are often unjustified in real scenes. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{illuminant and surface properties at each image location is painstaking. That noted, there are useful databases for evaluation of color constancy algorithms that provide information about illumination and/or surface reflectance (e.g., \citeNP{barnard2002data,ciurea2003large, cheng2014illuminant,NascimentoFoster2016}; see }\href{http://colorconstancy.com}{http://colorconstancy.com}\DIFadd{). Often the illumination is estimated through placement of a reflectance standard at a few image locations to allow estimation of the illumination impinging at those locations. This estimate is then interpolated/extrapolated across the image, an approximation whose quality is not yet well understood.  
}\DIFaddend 

Here we used labeled images rendered from virtual scene descriptions. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A similar approach has been used previously to study the perception of lightness and specularity \cite{toscani2013optimal,wiebel2015statistical,toscani2017lightness}. 
Our work adds to this approach through the addition of variation in color. 
}\DIFaddend There are many advantages to using rendered images \cite{Butler:ECCV:2012}. 
One advantage is that they allow us to work with large number of labeled images where object reflectance is precisely known at each pixel. A second advantage is that we can control the variation in distinct scene factors that might affect the difficulty of the estimation problem. This flexibility allows the study of individual scene factors as well as their combined effects. Here, we exploited this flexibility to quantify how variation in the relative reflectance spectrum of the target object, the spectrum of the illumination, and the reflectance spectrum of the background objects limit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend estimation. We also exploited our use of rendered images to explore how the presence or absence of secondary reflections from background objects affected estimation of target object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend . This type of question cannot be addressed using real images. The basic approach we use here can be extended to include parametric control over the amount of variation of different factors. For example, we could systematically vary the variances of the distribution over the weights that control the relative spectrum of the illumination.

There are also disadvantages associated with using rendered images. 
Virtual rendered scenes are not guaranteed to capture all of the task relevant variation that occurs in real scenes.
Even casual inspection of our images reveals that they are rendered, and not real.
However, computer graphics is getting better and we expect that the gap between virtual and natural image databases will steadily close.
Indeed, carefully constructed graphics images are now quite difficult to differentiate from real images.

To increase the representativeness of our rendered images, we used datasets of natural surface reflectance spectra and natural daylight illumination spectra. Although we believe these datasets provide reasonable approximations of the statistical variation in reflectance and illumination spectra, they can be extended and improved. For example, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the surface reflectance datasets capture regularities in naturally occurring reflectance functions, but the surfaces in the datasets were not sampled to reflect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there are additional datasets of measured surface reflectances that could be incorporated into future analyses, with some of these focused on the reflectance of objects (e.g. fruit) that are thought to be important for the evolution of primate color vision (e.g., \citeNP{sumner2000catarrhine, regan2001fruits, barnard2002data, ennis2018hyperspectral}). Another issue, not addressed by these datasets, is }\DIFaddend the relative frequency of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{occcurance of }\DIFaddend different reflectance spectra in natural viewing. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In addition, the dataset of illuminations does not include the artificial illuminations that we now live much of our lives under. Future work with virtual image datasets will benefit from targeted efforts to characterize additional features of the natural statistics of the scene components that are varied}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\citeNP{attewell2007distribution} made a systematic survey, and found that a beta distribution provided a better description of the distribution of an LRF-like quantity than did a truncated Gaussian. Generalizing these measurements to better characterize the distribution of full reflectance functions remains an interesting goal}\DIFaddend . 

\subsection{Future Directions}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend In the work presented here, we studied computational luminance constancy in virtual scenes with naturalistic spectral variation in light sources and in surface reflectance functions\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, with only matte surfaces in the scenes}\DIFaddend . It is natural to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{begin }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{start }\DIFaddend with spectral variation, because this variation is at the heart of what makes luminance constancy a rich computational problem. In natural scenes, however, there are other sources of variation that add additional richness\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and make the problem more difficult to solve}\DIFdelend . These include variation in non-spectral properties of objects and lighting in the scene, including object texture, material \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g. specularity)}\DIFaddend , and shape as well as lighting geometry. The methods we developed here may be generalized to study the effects of variation in these factors. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{That is, one }\DIFaddend could incorporate these other sources of variation into the generation of the scenes and again learn estimators from the corresponding labeled images. A challenge for this approach will be to thoughtfully control the increase in problem complexity, both to keep compute time feasible and to ensure that it is possible to extract meaningful insight from the results. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Extending the work to include variation of material may provide insights not only about luminance constancy but also for computations that relate to material perception (see \citeNP{fleming2017material}); extending the work to include variation in object shape and lighting geometry may clarify the role of object boundaries versus object interiors for providing information that supports perception of object color and lightness (see \citeNP{land1971lightness, rudd2016retinex}). We also note that there is a literature on how increasing stimulus complexity along the various lines listed above affects human color and lightness perception (e.g. \citeNP{beck1964effect,yang2001illuminant, yang2002stereo,todd2004lightness, snyder2005illumination, boyaci2003effect, xiao2008surface, kingdom2011lightness, xiao2012color, anderson2015perceptual, toscani2017lightness}), as well as the computational problem of color and lightness constancy (e.g. \citeNP{lee1986method, d1986mechanisms, funt1988color, tominaga1989standard, barron2012color, barron2015convolutional, finlayson2018colour}).
}\DIFaddend 


\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We studied the information available for LRF estimation using a 1°x1° image patch. As noted above this choice of size was motivated in part to use a spatial scale roughly commensurate with the scale of information integration in early visual cortex. Our general methods could be extended to study larger regions, and doing so would quantify the value of spatially remote information for luminance constancy. 
}

\DIFaddend Luminance constancy is a special case of the more general problem of color constancy.
The approach we developed here could also be generalized to the estimation of additional surface reflectance descriptors, such as object hue or chroma.
A further advance would be to develop methods for learning receptive fields that are optimal for multivariate estimation problems. 
With such methods one could directly estimate three-dimensional color descriptors.

\subsection{Linking to Human Performance}

An important motivation for studying the computational problem of luminance constancy is to gain insight about human vision.
The approach we developed can be used to make predictions of how humans would perform in a psychophysical task that probes the visual representation of object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF}\DIFaddend .
For example, one could study discrimination thresholds for target \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend using the stimuli that were generated with the methods used here.
More specifically, we could ask how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend discrimination thresholds are impacted by spectral variation in the illuminant, the background objects, and in the target object itself.
Comparing human thresholds with the precision of AMA-based estimates would then allow inferences about how well human observers make use of the information available in the images for performing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LRV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LRF }\DIFaddend discrimination.
We think experiments and analyses along these lines represent an important future direction.
